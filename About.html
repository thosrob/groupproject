<div class="tent">
         <p>Welcome to our site! We are a group of individuals that are passionate about gender equality. Today we are launching
            a campaign called All Girls Rock and we need your help. We want to end gender inequality,
            and to do this, we need everyone involved. We want to try to mobilize as many people as possible to be advocates for change.
            We don’t just want to talk about it...we want to try and make sure that it’s tangible.</p>
         <p>When most hear about feminism, it has too often become synonymous with man-hating. If there is one thing thats
            for certain, it is that this has to stop.</p>
       </div>
<div class="tent">
        <p>For the record, feminism by definition is the belief that men and women should have equal rights and opportunities. It
           is the theory of political, economic and social equality of the sexes.</p>
        <p>Questioning gender-based assumptions has been around a long time. We have 8 year olds that are confused about being
           called bossy because they want to direct the plays that they would put on for their parents, but the boys are not. Fourteen year olds
           are sexualized by certain elements of the media. At the age of 15, some girls begin dropping out off sports teams
           because they don't want to appear muscly. Then at 18, their male friends are unable to express their feelings. But they are
           feminist! Feminism has become an unpopular word. Women are choosing not to identify as feminists. Apparently, they are among
           the ranks of women whose expressions are seen as too strong, too aggressive, isolating, and anti-men. Unattractive, even.</p>
        </div>
  


  <div class="tent">
         <p>Why has the word become such an uncomfortable one? We think it is just to be paid the same as male counterparts. I think
          it is right that women should be able to make decisions about their own body. We believe it is right that
          women be involved in the policies and decisions that will affect their life. We think it is right that socially,
          women afforded the same respect as men. But sadly, there is no one country in the world where all women can expect to
          see these rights. No country in the world can yet say that they achieved gender equality. These rights...human rights.</p>
        <p>Some are privileged because their parents didn’t love them less because they were born a daughter. Some girls in schools
          did not have limits because they are girls. Mentors didn't assume that girls would go less far because they might give birth
          to a child one day. These influences are the gender equality ambassadors that make some girls who they are today. They
          may not know it, but they are the inadvertent feminists that are changing the world today. We need more of those. And
          if you still hate the word, it is not the word that is important. It’s the idea and the ambition behind it, because not
          all women have received the same rights. In fact, statistically, very few have.</p>
       </div>

       <div class="tent">
        <p>In 1997, Hillary Clinton made a famous speech in Beijing about women’s rights. Sadly, many of the things that she wanted
        to change are still true today. But what stood out the most was that less than thirty percent of the audience were
        male. How can we effect change in the world when only half of it is invited or feel welcome to participate in the
        conversation?</p>
        <p>We would like to take this opportunity to extend your formal invitation. Gender equality is your issue, too. Because
         to date, men role as a parent is being valued less by society, despite the need of their presence as a child,
         as much as a mother’s. Young men suffer from mental illness, unable to ask for help for fear it would make
         them less of a man. In fact, suicide is the biggest killer of men between 20 to 49, eclipsing road accidents,
         cancer and coronary heart disease. I’ve seen men made fragile and insecure by a distorted sense of what constitutes male
         success. Men don’t have the benefits of equality, either. We don’t often talk about men being imprisoned by gender
         stereotypes, but they are, and that when they are free, things will change for women as a natural consequence. If men
         don’t have to be aggressive in order to be accepted, women won’t feel compelled to be submissive. If men don’t have to
         control, women won’t have to be controlled.</p>
        <p>Both men and women should feel free to be sensitive. Both men and women should feel free to be strong. It is time
           that we all perceive gender on a spectrum, instead of two sets of opposing ideals. If we stop defining each other by
           what we are not, and start defining ourselves by who we are, we can all be freer, and this is what All Girls Rock is
           about. It’s about freedom.</p>
        <p>We want you to take up this mantle so that your daughters, sisters, and mothers can be free from prejudice, but also so
           that your sons have permission to be vulnerable and human too, reclaim those parts of themselves they abandoned, and
           in doing so, be a more true and complete version of themselves.</p>
      </div>


      <div class="tent">
        <p>You might be thinking, "Who is this crazy group?"...All we know is that we care about this problem, and want to make
           it better. Having seen what we’ve seen, and given the chance, we feel it is our responsibility to say something.
           Statesman Edmund Burke said, “All that is needed for the forces of evil to triumph is for good men and women to do nothing.”</p>
        <p>“If not us, who? If not now, when?” If you have similar doubts when opportunities are presented to you, I hope those
          words will be helpful. Because the reality is that if we do nothing, it will take seventy-five years, before women can
           expect to be paid the same as men for the same work. Fifteen and a half million girls will be married in the next 16
           years as children. At current rates, it won't be until 2086 before all rural African girls can have a secondary education.</p>
        <p>If you believe in equality, you might be one of those inadvertent feminists that we spoke of earlier, and for this,
           we applaud you. We are struggling for a uniting word, but the good news is, we have a uniting movement. It is called
           All Girls Rock. We invite you to step forward, to be seen and to ask yourself, “If not me, who? If not now, when?”
           Thank you very, very much.</p>
